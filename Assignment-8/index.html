        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
       <p>All these haters</p>
        <p>See you later</p>
        <p>All that I could do</p>
        <p>But you dont even feel me though</p>
        <p>I know you know I know you got that power</p>
        <p>That power</p>
        <p>Oh, oh oh</p>
        <p>So CG but a nigga stay real</p>
        <p>Though I'm fly I'm ill I'm running shit</p>
        <p>Three-points, field goal</p>
        <p>Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell</p>
        <p>'Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian bail</p>
        <p>Yeah, they starin' at me jealous cause I do shows bigger</p>
        <p>But your looks don't help, like an old gold digger</p>
        <p>Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer</p>
        <p>So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas</p>
        <p>Yeah, now that's the line of the century</p>
        <p>Niggas missed it, too busy</p>
        <p>They lyin' 'bout penitentiary</p>
        <p>Man, you ain't been there</p>
        <p>Nigga you been scared</p>
        <p>And I'm still living single like Synclaire</p>
        <p>Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate</p>
        <p>When I wasn't white enough to use your pool when I was 8</p>
        <p>Stone Mountain you raised me well</p>
        <p>I'm stared at by Confederates but hard as hell</p>
        <p>Tight jeans penny loafers, but I still drink a Bodine</p>
        <p>Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides</p>
        <p>I'm just a kid who blowing up with my father's name</p>
        <p>And every black "you're not black enough"</p>
        <p>Is a white "you're all the same"</p>
        <p>Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes</p>
        <p>'Cause its oreos, twinkies, coconuts, delicious</p>
        <p>How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?</p>
        <p>I said I want a full house</p>
        <p>They said, "You got it dude!"</p>
        <p>All these haters</p>
        <p>See you later</p>
        <p>All that I could do</p>
        <p>But you don't even feel me though</p>
        <p>I know you know I know you got that power</p>
        <p>That power</p>
        <p>Oh, oh oh</p>
        <p>Holla, holla, holla, holla at yo boy</p>
        <p>Like yo dad when he's pissed off</p>
        <p>Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk</p>
        <p>Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk</p>
        <p>People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long</p>
        <p>Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'</p>
        <p>And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins</p>
        <p>How'd it happen? Honesty did it</p>
        <p>See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit</p>
        <p>Yeah I bodied the limits and I get at them fakers</p>
        <p>Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters</p>
        <p>So, my studio be a funeral</p>
        <p>Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?</p>
        <p>Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den</p>
        <p>Man I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead</p>
        <p>On stage with my family in front of me</p>
        <p>I am what I am: everything I wanna be</p>
        <p>All these haters</p>
        <p>See you later</p>
        <p>All that I could do</p>
        <p>But you don't even feel me though</p>
        <p>I know you know I know you got that power</p>
        <p>That power</p>
        <p>This is on a bus back from camp</p>
        <p>I'm 13 and so are you</p>
        <p>Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four</p>
        <p>Other dudes I hadn't met yet</p>
        <p>Running around all summer, getting into trouble</p>
        <p>It turned out it would be me and just one girl</p>
        <p>That's you</p>
        <p>And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not</p>
        <p>At the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us</p>
        <p>We're still wearing our orange camp T-shirts</p>
        <p>We still smell like pineneedles</p>
        <p>I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you</p>
        <p>But I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me</p>
        <p>You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer</p>
        <p>>Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to</p>
        <p>Talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on</p>
        <p>A girl who's smart and funny and who</p>
        <p>If I say something dumb for a laugh</p>
        <p>Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me</p>
        <p>Laugh, but who also gets weird and</p>
        <p>Wise sometimes in a way I could never be</p>
        <p>A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her</p>
        <p>Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it</p>
        <p>From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet</p>
        <p>Back in the real world we don't go to the same school</p>
        <p>And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically</p>
        <p>Different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school</p>
        <p>So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something</p>
        <p>And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something</p>
        <p>The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet</p>
        <p>A lot of kids were asleep</p>
        <p>We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop</p>
        <p>That looks like a kid we know, and then I'm like</p>
        <p>"Can I tell you something?" And all of a sudden I'm telling you</p>
        <p>And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming</p>
        <p>And your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass</p>
        <p>Underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway</p>
        <p>And there's no expression on it</p>
        <p>And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the</p>
        <p>Time where we live in a world where</p>
        <p>You haven't said "yes" or "no" yet</p>
        <p>And regrettably I end up using the word "destiny."</p>
        <p>I don't remember in what context</p>
        <p>Doesn't really matter</p>
        <p>Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, "okay."</p>
        <p>I don't know exactly what you mean by it</p>
        <p>But it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to</p>
        <p>Spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus</p>
        <p>So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am</p>
        <p>I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore</p>
        <p>The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on</p>
        <p>I turn and you're not there</p>
        <p>Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore</p>
        <p>We're parked at the pick-up point</p>
        <p>Which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church</p>
        <p>The bus is half empty</p>
        <p>You might be in your dad's car by now</p>
        <p>Your bags and things piled high in the trunk</p>
        <p>The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and</p>
        <p>Taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the</p>
        <p>Aisle to get up off the bus</p>
        <p>Just as one of them reaches my row</p>
        <p>They used to be our row, on our way off</p>
        <p>It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week</p>
        <p>After throwing rocks at my head</p>
        <p>Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body wise</p>
        <p>She stops and looks down at me</p>
        <p>And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light</p>
        <p>So I can't really see her face</p>
        <p>But I can see her smile. And she says one word</p>
        <p>"Destiny."</p>
        <p>Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her</p>
        <p>All laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus</p>
        <p>I didn't know you were friends with them</p>
        <p>I find my dad in the parking lot</p>
        <p>He drives me back to our house and camp is over</p>
        <p>So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts</p>
        <p>This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad</p>
        <p>This is a story about how I learned something</p>
        <p>And I'm not saying this thing is true or not</p>
        <p>I'm just saying it's what I learned</p>
        <p>I told you something</p>
        <p>It was just for you and you told everybody</p>
        <p>So I learned cut out the middle man</p>
        <p>Make it all for everybody, always</p>
        <p>Everybody can't turn around and tell</p>
        <p>Everybody, everybody already knows, I told them</p>
        <p>But this means there isn't a place</p>
        <p>In my life for you or someone like you</p>
        <p>Is it sad?</p>
        <p>Sure</p>
        <p>But it's a sadness I chose</p>
        <p>I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a</p>
        <p>Boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit</p>
        <p>But that's not true</p>
        <p>The truth is I got on the bus a boy</p>
        <p>And I never got off the bus</p>
        <p>I still haven't</p>

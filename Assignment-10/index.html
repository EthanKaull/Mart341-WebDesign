        <strong>Skiing in Bozeman</strong> is (in my opinion) the best place in Montana to ski. Going to the ski hill <strong>Bridger Bowl</strong>, It's a sure fire way to have one of the best ski days of your life. I was blessed to grow up in bozeman and experience the hill day after day. It was a slap to the face when I decided to ski somewhere else expecting the same level of snow.

    <strong>Skiing in Missoula</strong> is not too far behind bozeman in terms of good skiing. Moving from bozeman to Missoula for college, I was skeptical at first about the potential for skiing here, though I was pleasently surprised by <strong>Snowbowl</strong>, as it has great skiing. I may be biased, but I still believe that Bozeman has the best ski hill in Montana.

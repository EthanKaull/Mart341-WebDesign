            Tears of the Kingdom takes place after the events of Breath of the Wild, in which Link successfully defeats Calamity Ganon. It’s not exactly clear how long after that battle we pick up from, but it seems that a few years have passed. In any case, the story begins with Link and Zelda exploring the depths of Hyrule. They discover a few key things down there, including a red substance called gloom that’s infecting Hyrule.

            The bigger discovery, though, is a set of murals depicting an event called the Imprisoning War. That conflict saw the ancient people of Hyrule (the lost Zonai race) fighting the Demon King Ganondorf and sealing him away. While The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past also had an Imprisoning War with a similar premise, the event in Tears of the Kingdom appears to be its own thing entirely. Shortly after that, Link and Zelda actually find the imprisoned corpse of Ganondorf, which has been sealed with a tear-like stone. That doesn’t last long.

            Ganondorf springs to life, which causes Link to draw the Master Sword a weapon powerful enough to defeat him. Unfortunately, Ganondorf uses the gloom to destroy both the sword and Link’s arm. Most notable about the scene is that Ganondorf somehow knows who Link and Zelda are, mocking someone named Rauru for putting their faith in Link. With the heroes thwarted, Ganondorf raises Hyrule Castle into the sky. Zelda falls into the blackness below before disappearing with a yellow flash, while a mysterious blue arm brings Link to safety on the Sky Islands above.

            We learn that Link was saved by the spirit of Rauru, an ancient Zonai creature who was the first king of Hyrule. It turns out Ganondorf destroyed Link’s arm in the encounter, so Rauru replaced it with a mechanical one that he’s able to communicate through. After completing a few shrines, Rauru leads Link to the Temple of Time, where he places his destroyed Master Sword on a pedestal. It disappears, but somehow reappears in front of Zelda in the same location.

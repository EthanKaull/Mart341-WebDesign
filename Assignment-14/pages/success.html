            “Tears of the Kingdom” sold 10 million copies in its first three days, quickly becoming the fastest selling game in Nintendo history. Although Nintendo has yet to reveal revenue numbers, the first three days of sales would amount to, at minimum, $700 million based on the $70 game price (although there are more expensive pricing tiers available as well). It will likely become the best selling game of the year and could become one of the best selling games of the last few years.

            The critical and commercial success of the sequel to “Breath of the Wild,” which was proclaimed a masterpiece when it was released in 2017, is unsurprising in many ways. The Nintendo Switch is one of the most widely adopted gaming consoles, with 130 million sold worldwide, according to Nintendo.

            But the reason people have flocked to “Tears of the Kingdom” is about more than just the success of “Breath of the Wild.” The game’s emphasis on freedom and creativity says a lot about what players want out of video games––and it has plenty to teach the games industry, say game design experts at Northeastern University. It turns out players just want to play.

            Like every Zelda game, players are put in the shoes of Link, a pointy eared, green tunic wearing warrior who must rescue the kingdom of Hyrule and Princess Zelda from the villainous Ganon. And like “Breath of the Wild,” “Tears of the Kingdom” provides a massive, freely explorable open world version of that formula. It also gives players a new set of tools that greatly expand what they can do in creative––and often ridiculous––ways.

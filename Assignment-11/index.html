To progress, players engage in battles against AI-controlled fighters, each represented by a spirit, and must strategically choose their own spirits to enhance their abilities. The mode features diverse challenges, puzzle-solving elements, and epic boss battles against the likes of Galeem and Dharkon. As players uncover the map, they unlock new fighters and collectibles, providing a unique and engaging single-player experience within the larger Super Smash Bros. Ultimate game.
